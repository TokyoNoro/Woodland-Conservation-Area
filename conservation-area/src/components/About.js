        Nestled in the heart of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the St. Margaret’s Bay Area Woodland Conservation Site is a sanctuary of natural beauty and biodiversity. Spanning an impressive 200 acres, this conservation area is a verdant tapestry of towering trees, lush undergrowth, and vibrant wildlife.

        The woodland is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including the majestic Red Maple, the delicate Wild Carrot, and the robust Coltsfoot. The Sheep Laurel and Multiflora Rose add a splash of color to the landscape, while the Star-nose Mole and the Little Brown Bat represent some of the unique wildlife species that inhabit the area.
